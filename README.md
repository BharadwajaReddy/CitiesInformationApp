# CitiesInformationApp
BB project

Things i have implemented in this project.
1)MVVM architecture and Kotlin programming language.
2)Filter functionality using binary search algorithm.
3)Recycler view which accepts city list.
4) I have used LinkedLIst for the entire project because of the advantages of it.
5)Support for orientation changes.
6)When the user clicks on the city list item, the location opens in the map. (Tested in emulator).
7)I have used Fragment in the activity for implementing the 
8)Test cases are implemeted in test module using JUNIT4. And it is passing all [possible use cases.



Note: I have not implemented some important performancing tuning things, like search in the "already searched list" to avoid time delay and increase performance. 
And also not implemented the restoring filter state when orientation changes. I have not done  this because of time constraint.
